    "\n",
    "- It is one of the most critical security risks to web applications. Injection attacks occur when an attacker sends malicious input to an application, which is then interpreted as code and executed by the application. This can lead to data theft, data loss, or even complete system compromise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some of the most common types of injection attacks and their potential impact:\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Injection:** Attackers can use SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL commands on a database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. The cost of SQL injection attacks can vary widely depending on the size of the organization and the amount of data that is compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command Injection:** Attackers can use command injection to execute arbitrary commands on a server, allowing them to take control of the system. The cost of command injection attacks can vary widely depending on the size of the organization and the amount of damage that is done. \n",
    "\n",
    "**LDAP Injection:** Attackers can use LDAP injection to execute arbitrary LDAP commands on a directory server, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data. The cost of LDAP injection attacks can vary widely depending on the size of the organization and the amount of data that is compromised."

    "- XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end-user. The malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Stored XSS Attacks:** Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a comment field or message board. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **British Airways:** In 2018, British Airways was attacked by Magecart, a high-profile hacker group famous for credit card skimming attacks. The group exploited an XSS vulnerability in a JavaScript library called Feedify, which was used on the British Airway website. Attackers modified the script to send customer data to a malicious server, which used a domain name similar to British Airways. The fake server had an SSL certificate, so users believed they were purchasing from a secure server. They succeeded in performing credit card skimming on 380,000 booking transactions before the breach was discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fortnite:** In 2019, the popular multiplayer game experienced an XSS vulnerability that over 200 million users. A retired, unsecured page went unnoticed by Fortnite developers. The page had an XSS vulnerability that allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to the data of all Fornite users. Attackers could have used XSS, in combination with an insecure single sign on (SSO) vulnerability, to redirect users to a fake login page. This would allow them to steal virtual currency within the game, and record player conversations, as reconnaissance for future attacks. Check Point discovered the attack and notified Fortnite, but it is unknown if the vulnerability was exploited by attackers in the interim.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **eBay:** In late 2015 and early 2016, eBay had a severe XSS vulnerability. The website used a “url” parameter that redirected users to different pages on the platform, but the value of the parameter was not validated. This allowed attackers to inject malicious code into a page. The vulnerability enabled attackers to gain full access to eBay seller accounts, sell products at a discount, and steal payment details."
