    "## Common Web Application Security Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web application security risks refer to vulnerabilities and weaknesses that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the security of web applications.\n",
    "- **Zero-day vulnerabilities:** These are vulnerabilities unknown to an applicationâ€™s makers, and which thus do not have a fix available. We now see more than 20,000 every year. Attacks look to exploit these vulnerabilities quickly, and often follow up by seeking to evade protections put in place by security vendors.\n",
    "- **Denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks:** Through a variety of vectors, attackers are able to overload a targeted server or its surrounding infrastructure with different types of attack traffic. When a server is no longer able to effectively process incoming requests, it begins to behave sluggishly and eventually deny service to incoming requests from legitimate users.\n",
    "- **Page scraping:** Attackers may also use bots to steal content from webpages on a large scale. They may use this content to gain a pricing advantage over a competitor, imitate the page owner for malicious purposes, or other reasons.\n",
    "- **API abuse:** APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are software that allow two applications to communicate with each other. Like any type of software, they may have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to send malicious code into one of the applications or intercept sensitive data as it moves from one application to another. This is an increasingly common attack type as API use increases. The OWASP API Top ten list succinctly summarized key API security risks organizations face today."
