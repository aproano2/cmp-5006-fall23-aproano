# Research Topics Web Security

## 1. Kali Linux

### Introduction

Kali Linux is a powerful operating system specifically designed for penetration testing and ethical hacking. It provides a wide range of tools and resources to assess the security of web applications and networks. In this material, we will guide you through the installation process of Kali Linux and introduce you to some of its key features and functionalities.

### Installation Guide

Visit the official Kali Linux website (https://www.kali.org/downloads/) and download the appropriate version of Kali Linux for your system.

### Lab Exercises

As a reference, you can use Kali Linux in the following situations. You can take advantage of the tools provided to apply them in your PicoCTF homework. 

1. **Scanning and Enumeration**: Use Kali Linux to scan and enumerate a target web application. Identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities using tools like Nmap, Nikto, and OpenVAS.

2. **Web Application Penetration Testing**: Perform a web application penetration test using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, or SQLMap. Identify common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and insecure direct object references (IDOR).

3. **Wireless Network Security**: Use Kali Linux to assess the security of a wireless network. Perform a wireless network scan, crack WEP or WPA/WPA2 passwords, and analyze network traffic using tools like Aircrack-ng, Reaver, and Wireshark.

4. **Social Engineering**: Explore the techniques of social engineering using Kali Linux. Conduct phishing attacks, create malicious email campaigns, and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems.

5. **Password Cracking**: Use Kali Linux to crack passwords using tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat. Learn about different password cracking techniques such as dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and rainbow table attacks.

6. **Web Server Security**: Assess the security of a web server using Kali Linux. Perform vulnerability scanning, exploit known vulnerabilities, and secure the web server by implementing best practices.

7. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Analyze network traffic using Kali Linux tools like Wireshark or tcpdump. Capture and analyze packets to identify potential security threats, suspicious activities, or unauthorized access attempts.

## 2. OWASP Top 10

1. **Injection**: What are the different types of injection attacks, and how can they be exploited? Provide examples of real-world incidents where injection vulnerabilities were exploited.
2. **Broken Authentication**: How can broken authentication lead to unauthorized access? What are some common authentication vulnerabilities and how can they be prevented?
3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: What types of sensitive data are commonly exposed in web applications? How can sensitive data exposure be prevented or mitigated?
4. **XML External Entities (XXE)**: What is an XML External Entity attack? How can it be used to exploit web applications? Provide examples of XXE vulnerabilities and their impact.
5. **Broken Access Control**: What are the consequences of broken access control? How can access control vulnerabilities be identified and fixed?
6. **Security Misconfiguration**: What are the common security misconfigurations in web applications? How can they be exploited by attackers? Provide examples of security misconfigurations and their impact.
7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: What is cross-site scripting and how does it work? How can XSS vulnerabilities be exploited? Provide examples of real-world XSS attacks.
8. **Insecure Deserialization**: What is insecure deserialization and how can it be exploited? What are the potential risks associated with insecure deserialization?
9. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: How can using components with known vulnerabilities impact the security of web applications? What are some strategies to mitigate this risk?
10. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**: Why is logging and monitoring important for web application security? What are the consequences of insufficient logging and monitoring?

## 3. WAF

We will explore the concept of Web Application Firewall (WAF) and its role in protecting applications from the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. We will also delve into the implementation of WAFs to gain a comprehensive understanding of their functionality and effectiveness.

1. What is a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and how does it differ from a traditional firewall?
2. What are the common types of attacks that WAFs can protect against?
3. How does a WAF mitigate the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities?
4. What are the key features and capabilities of a WAF?
5. What are the challenges and limitations of implementing a WAF?

## 4. Threat Modeling

1. What is threat modeling and why is it important in web security?
2. What are the different techniques used to perform threat modeling?
3. How can threat modeling help in identifying potential vulnerabilities in web applications?
4. What are the common challenges faced while performing threat modeling?
5. How can threat modeling be integrated into the software development lifecycle?
